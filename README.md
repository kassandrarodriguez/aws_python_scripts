The following scripts are scripts that I had made under my Work Github.
I am posting it in my personal github with modifications that won't reveal any confidential informations about my company.

**"desiredCountApi.py"** checks through api for desired vs running.  


Checks in AWS if the desired tasks are the same as running tasks of every cluster and outputs only if desired count does not equal running count.
